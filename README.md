# Movie Rating AI

This is an autoencoder movie rating AI. An autoencoder is a type of artificial neural network used to learn efficient data codings in an unsupervised manner. Specifically, it is a stacked autoencoder, which means it has multiple hidden layers. Here's a great resource on autoencoders: https://skymind.ai/wiki/stacked-denoising-autoencoder.

This autoencoder predicts the ratings (1-5) a user would give to a specific movie. I achieved a test loss of 95%, meaning it has a 95% accuracy .

## Prerequisites

This project uses Python 3. You will need  PyTorch, Numpy, Matplotlib, and so on. I used Spyder on Anaconda to code this.
